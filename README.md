# File Extension Extractor

Extract a file's extension. 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download project's zip</li>
  <li>Compile the project</li>
  <li>Generate jar library</li>
  <li>Add jar as external reference</li>
</ol>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
A previous project I had worked needed the ability to extract a file's extension with or without the dot, so I had created a Java library that facilitates this task and decided to upload the project to Github as a reference or potential library for others.

<h2>Info</h2>
Concrete child class includes a 2 argument method that indicates whether or not to include the dot portion of the extension
