<h2>Motivation</h2>
A previous project I had worked needed the ability to extract a file's extension with or without the dot, so I had created a Java library that facilitates this task and decided to upload the project to Github as a reference or potential library for others.

<h2>Info</h2>
This project contains an abstract base class that provides methods for extracting a file's extension with the dot and a child class containing 3 extra 2 argument methods that indicate whether or not to extract the extension with the dot.
